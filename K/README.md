K is a clone of the 2048 video game. Instead of aiming for the 11th power of 2, the goal of this game is to reach the 11th letter in the alphabet, which is 'K'.
Written in Jack, a minimal OOP language created by creators of the [Nand2Tetris course](http://nand2tetris.org).

Controls:
- Arrow keys to move the letters
- R to restart
- Q to quit

Caveats. The pseudorandom number generator is far from industrial strength, so you may notice new letters are more likely to spawn in certain locations than others...
